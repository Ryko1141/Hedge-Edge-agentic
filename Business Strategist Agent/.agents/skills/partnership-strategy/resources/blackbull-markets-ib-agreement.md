IN ADDITION TO ANY OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH ANYWHERE IN THIS AGREEMENT OR UNDER
APPLICABLE LAW, THE REFERRAL PARTNER SHALL NOT BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE ANY FEES FOR ANY CLIENT/QUALIFIED

THE FOREGOING HAS BEEN APPROVED AND QUALIFIED BY COMPANY. FOR THE REMOVAL OF ANY DOUBT IT IS HEREBY
CLARIFIED THAT THE COMPANY RESERVES THE RIGHT, AT ITS SOLE AND ABSOLUTE DISCRETION, TO CHANGE, MODIFY,
ADD OR REMOVE, AT ANY TIME, ANY CRITERIA APPLYING TO ANY COMMISSION, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION,

and Clients or encouragement of trading activity intended to generate Commission and not profits);
4.10.3. have been obtained by misleading or deceptive conduct and/or through collusion and/or manipulation of
BlackBull’s or Group’s services, system, bonuses and/or promotions (including without limitation, via offers to
share the Commission directly or indirectly with Customers, and any other unauthorised use of any third-party
accounts, copyrights, or trademarks), in each case, regardless of whether or not it actually causes harm to any
Group Company;

personal details;
4.10.5. having been systematically falsified via a third-party device, program, robot, IP address, redirect or traffic

For avoidance of doubt and without derogating from the generality of the foregoing, the Referral Partner shall not be
entitled to receive Commission and/or any other payment (pursuant to any arrangement between the Referral Partner
and BlackBull, on its own behalf or on behalf of any other member of the Group) if BlackBull has a reason to believe that

shall have a right to reject any payment to the Referral Partner hereunder if the Referral Partner is not the sole beneficiary
in the payment details provided by the Referral Partner to BlackBull. BlackBull shall not be liable for any errors or
inaccuracies in the payment details provided by the Referral Partner.
4.12. Commission shall be payable to the Referral Partner in United States Dollars only unless BlackBull elects at its discretion
to affect a payment in any other currency.
4.13. The Referral Partner shall bear its own costs in providing Services hereunder and shall be solely responsible for the
payment of all its personnel, marketing, communication, administration and other overhead expenses, taxes and/or
charges and/or fees and duties arising from the provision of Services pursuant to this Agreement (including on domain

4.14. It is agreed by both Parties, that the Commission payable by BlackBull Group Limited or any other Group Company to the
Referral Partner is subject to review from time to time.
4.15. Without prejudice to the provisions of Clause 23 (Indemnity and Remedial Action) below, the Commission payable by

Commission already paid to the Referral Partner up to the amount of a reasonable estimate of BlackBull’s loss resulting

prejudice to any other rights which BlackBull or the Group may have against the Referral Partner, whether arising under
law, contract or otherwise.

and the Referral Partner in writing.
4.17. BlackBull may, in its sole and absolute discretion, provide (on its own part or on behalf of any member of the Group)
additional remuneration in the form of a reward, based on qualitative and other criteria that BlackBull may establish from
time to time, having also regard to Applicable Laws and Regulations.
4.18. BlackBull Group Limited has the absolute right to change the Commission payable to the Referral Partner for reasons
related to any of the Companies remuneration policy by either (i) posting such change on the website or (ii) giving to the
Referral Partner notice by e-mail. Where the Referral Partner does not return to BlackBull with written objections to the
proposed changes to the Commission and continues to provide Services after receiving or being deemed to have received
notice in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or the Referral Partner receives payment calculated according
to such modified terms, the Referral Partner will be deemed to have accepted such change in the Commission payable,
by conduct. For the avoidance of doubt, any change in Commission made hereunder shall apply, from the date on which
any such change became effective, which at BlackBull’s election can be up to thirty (30) days retroactive from date of
notice, shall apply with respect to both the Clients referred by the Referral Partner prior to such change and the Clients
referred after such change.

collusion between Referral Partners and Clients or encouragement of trading activity intended to generate Commission
and not profits) and/or from any other reasonable grounds in BlackBull’s sole and absolute discretion. In such event,
effective as of the date specified in BlackBull’s notification to the Referral Partner regarding the change of the
Commission, the Referral Partner shall be compensated under the new compensation plan and it shall not be entitled to
receive any payment under the previous compensation plan (and in the event that any payments have already been made
under the previous compensation plan, the Referral Partner shall immediately return to BlackBull Group Limited any such
payment and BlackBull shall also be permitted to deduct such payments from any future payments due to the Referral
Partner, which may cause a Referral Partner’s account to be in a negative balance.
